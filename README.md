# Sayid

Sayid *(siy EED)* is an omniscient debugger and profiler for Clojure. It extracts secrets from code at run-time.

[site](http://clojure-emacs.github.io/sayid)

**We're looking for more maintainers for the project. If you're interested in helping out please ping @bbatsov.**

## Updating the site

Sayid's simple site is just a static HTML page in the `/docs` folder that's being automatically deployed to GitHub pages
straight from the `master` branch.

If you need to update the site, you simply have to update the `index.html` file there.
